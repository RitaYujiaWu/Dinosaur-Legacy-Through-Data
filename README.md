# Dinosaur Legacy Through Data - Triassic to Cretaceous
This is a project for DS3 DataHacks 2024  
This project focused on visualizing the dinosaur data from the Triassic to the Cretaceous in the Jurassic Park dataset we found on Kaggle, analyzing and rationalizing the trend of dinosaur types and characteristics from temporal and geographical aspects.
